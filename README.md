Personal attempts to solve famous projectEuler problems

Please note that you need to solve projecteuler problems on your own. If this was about copying and pasting, here you could have seen solutions for almost all problems. I am just rying to do it in my way.

The reason why I share it is the same as why projecteuler has a forum for solutions. As soon as I solve a problem on projecteuler, I would like to see how others solved it or is there a better way to solve it. So I generally go to forum. 

At the end, these solutions are only published to present another point of view to people who have already solved the problem and are just curious.
